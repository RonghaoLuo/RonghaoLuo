# 👋 Hi there
Share your idea, and together we’ll turn it into a fully playable game prototype.


# 🚀 About Me
My name is Ronghao Luo. I am currently doing the [Game Development Bootcamp](https://www.circuitstream.com/bootcamp/game-development) online program from [Circuit Stream](https://www.circuitstream.com/) Network. I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. I build playable Unity prototypes—like my procedural platformer—and thrive working with teams to craft engaging games of any genre.
